## Goals

* Why did I do this?
* How to choose the problem to solve?
* An overview of the tech
* Show me the code!
* What can (will!) I do better / differently in the next version?

## Why do this?

<ul>
<li class="fragment" >I needed to learn new things to stay current in my career.</li>
<li class="fragment" >I wanted to solve a practical problem in my life.</li>
<li class="fragment" >It was fun.</li>
</ul>

NOTES: Why do this? I mean, it's way more complicated and expensive than it needs to be. I could have accomplished the goal with a $15 thermometer.

## How to choose the problem to solve?


<p class="fragment">What will make your daily life more:</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment" >Fun</li>
<li class="fragment" >Efficient</li>
<li class="fragment" >What tech are you trying to learn?</li>
</ul>

NOTES: It really comes down to two things: what's fun, and what will help you have more time? With Freddy, by using tech I don't have to go over and check his temperature constantly, plus I'm confident that I'll know if something goes wrong. What are some examples in your own lives?
